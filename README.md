## Install

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install reserved-email-addresses-list email-addresses
```


## Usage

The string you are comparing with must be converted to lowercase and trimmed of whitespace. The reason we are converting to lowercase is because the dictionary of words we are comparing with are all lowercase, and in order to compare for strict equality, we must have matching case.

It is also highly recommended that you check for strict equality, and for a list of admin, mailer-daemon, and no-reply usernames, you should check for strict equality, starts with, or ends with comparisons as well.

```js
const reservedEmailAddressesList = require('reserved-email-addresses-list');
const reservedAdminList = require('reserved-email-addresses-list/admin-list.json');
const emailAddresses = require('email-addresses');

const email = '"Admin***!!!"@example.com';
const parsed = emailAddresses.parseOneAddress(email);

if (parsed === null) throw new Error('Email was not a valid address');

const str = parsed.local.toLowerCase();

let reservedMatch = reservedEmailAddressesList.find(addr => addr === str);

if (!reservedMatch)
  reservedMatch = reservedAdminList.find(
    addr => addr === str || str.startsWith(addr) || str.endsWith(addr)
  );

if (reservedMatch)
  throw new Error(
    'User must be a domain admin to create an alias with a reserved word (see https://forwardemail.net/reserved-email-addresses).'
  );
```


## Lists

* [index.json](index.json) - list of all reserved generic usernames (**includes [admin-list.json](admin-list.json)**)
* [admin-list.json](admin-list.json) - list of all reserved admin, mailer-daemon, and no-reply usernames

### Formats

The default list [index.json](index.json) itself comes in a few different formats. The default import is an `Array`, but also available are a `Map` and `Set` version of the list.

```js
// Array version
const reservedEmailAddressesList = require('reserved-email-addresses-list');
// Also available with: require('reserved-email-addresses-list/array');

// Map version
const reservedEmailAddressesMap = require('reserved-email-addresses-list/map');

// Set version
const reservedEmailAddressesSet = require('reserved-email-addresses-list/set');
```

If you would like to create a Map or Set version of the other lists, simply require them first, and then convert to a `Set` or `Map` (see [map.cjs](map.cjs), [set.cjs](set.cjs), and other files in this repo for more insight how to do this).
